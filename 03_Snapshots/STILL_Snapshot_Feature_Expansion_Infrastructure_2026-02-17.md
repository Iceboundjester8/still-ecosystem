# STILL — SNAPSHOT
## Title: Feature Expansion Infrastructure Stabilized
## Date: 2026-02-17
## Trigger: Completion of Feature Expansion Request Thread
## Status: Locked Snapshot

---

# SNAPSHOT PURPOSE

This snapshot records the stabilization of the ecosystem infrastructure layer following the Feature Expansion Request thread.

No gameplay systems were added during this phase.

This snapshot marks the formalization of:

- Global ecosystem database architecture
- Mod registry structure
- Multi-mod mapping model
- Trello-style workflow automation
- Governance gating logic
- Dependency enforcement model
- Vanilla Test automation
- Dashboard aggregation structure

---

# WHAT IS NOW STABLE

## 1. Relational Ecosystem Model

The ecosystem now consists of:

- MOD_REGISTRY
- SYSTEM_REGISTRY
- MOD_SYSTEM_MAP
- FEATURE_MASTER_INDEX
- GLOBAL_DASHBOARD
- Per-mod BOARD_<MOD_ID> sheets

All sheets follow a unified schema.

No duplication.
No scope collapsing.
No reinterpretation of mod boundaries.

---

## 2. Governance Enforcement

Hard gates enforced at execution level:

- Approval required before execution.
- Dependencies block progression.
- Vanilla Score auto-calculates.
- DO NOT IMPLEMENT is enforceable.
- PLACEHOLDER status visually distinct.
- DENIED FEATURE non-executable.

Governance precedes development.

---

## 3. Workflow Discipline

Workflow Column formalized:

Backlog  
In Progress  
Blocked  
Review  
Done

Status and Workflow are separate dimensions.

Design maturity does not equal implementation state.

---

## 4. Mod Hierarchy Clarified

Confirmed:

- Mods may overlap.
- Systems may belong to multiple mods.
- Lens mods are first-class.
- Infrastructure mods exist independently.
- Deferred content still exists in registry.
- Philosophy layers are valid canonical systems.

No more collapsing of abstract scopes.

---

## 5. Identified Constraint

Full ecosystem reconstruction requires re-ingestion of canonical data dumps.

This snapshot does not fabricate missing data.

It stabilizes infrastructure only.

# STATE OF PROJECT AT SNAPSHOT

Infrastructure: Stable  
Governance: Enforced  
Execution Model: Structured  
Automation: Operational  
Expansion Scope: Unchanged  
Feature Count: Unchanged

This snapshot marks the end of the Feature Expansion Infrastructure phase.

---

# SNAPSHOT LOCK

Feature Expansion Infrastructure is considered structurally complete as of this date.

Future changes to:

- Database schema
- Governance rules
- Workflow model
- Mod registry structure

Require new snapshot.

END SNAPSHOT
