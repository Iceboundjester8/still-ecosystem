# STILL — SNAPSHOT
## Title: Stilllife Foundation Lock (v1)
## Snapshot ID: STILL_Snapshot_Stilllife_Foundation_2026-02-17
## Date: 2026-02-17
## Scope: Core Domestic Systems (stilllife)
## Status: Locked

---

# I. SNAPSHOT PURPOSE

This snapshot locks the foundational domestic systems of stilllife.

These systems define:

- Comfort-layer mechanics
- Ritual behaviors
- Decorative resonance
- Non-advantage-based interaction
- Domestic atmosphere systems

This snapshot freezes core architecture only.
Variants and content expansions remain separate.

---

# II. LOCKED DOMESTIC SYSTEMS

## 1. Tea System (Comfort Only)

- Consumable ritual item
- Provides temporary cosmetic comfort
- No stat increases
- No permanent effects
- No scaling tiers

Teas are experiential, not optimal.

No “best tea.”

---

## 2. Herb System (Dual-State Vegetation)

Each herb may exist as:

- Decorative state
- Functional state

Functional state must:
- Never create progression loop
- Never become farming meta
- Never escalate power

Herbs are environmental extensions, not resources.

---

## 3. Incense System

- Ambient burner interaction
- Produces sound, light, scent implication
- Subtle environmental shift only

No aura buffs.
No range-based advantages.
No stacking effects.

---

## 4. Brazier System

- Physical ritual object
- Accepts incense or fuel
- Emits atmospheric changes only

No mechanical efficiency.
No automation hooks.
No optimization incentives.

---

## 5. Resonant Trim System

- Visual-only armor/tool layer
- Cosmetic shimmer or tone shift
- No stat bonuses
- No hidden modifiers

Trims are expression, not escalation.

---

## 6. Domestic Artifacts

Includes:

- Lore fragments
- Decorative relics
- Memory objects

Artifacts must:
- Avoid quest chains
- Avoid unlock trees
- Avoid progression gates

They are discovered, not chased.

---

# III. DESIGN GUARANTEES

Stilllife must:

- Provide comfort only
- Never create permanent advantage
- Avoid “best choice” logic
- Avoid efficiency incentives
- Remain ignorable

If removed, vanilla survival balance is unchanged.

---

# IV. EXPLICIT NON-INCLUSIONS

The following are permanently excluded from stilllife foundation:

- Permanent buffs
- Skill trees
- Cooking meta optimization
- Efficiency stacking
- Player stat scaling
- Unlock chains
- Ritual power systems

Stilllife is atmosphere-first, not advantage-first.

---

# V. GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT

All systems above:

- Passed My Vanilla Test (all categories ≥ 4)
- Approved = O prior to lock
- Do not violate Hard Cuts
- Are variant-extensible but mechanic-stable

Foundation mechanics are frozen.

Variants may expand content, not introduce new mechanics.

---

# VI. SNAPSHOT RULES

This snapshot is immutable.

Future changes require:

- New snapshot ID
- Append-only revision
- Governance re-evaluation

No retroactive modification.

---

# VII. EFFECTIVE DATE

Stilllife Foundation Lock effective:

2026-02-17
