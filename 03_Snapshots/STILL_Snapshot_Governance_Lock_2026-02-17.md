# III. GOVERNANCE STATE AT LOCK

## Hard Cuts (Non-Negotiable)

- No UI meters
- No quests
- No progression gates
- No mana systems
- No power escalation

When in doubt: cut it.
Absence is valid design.

---

## My Vanilla Test Enforcement

Each category must score ≥ 4.

- Vanilla Fit ≥ 4
- Complexity ≥ 4
- Immersion ≥ 4
- Longevity ≥ 4

Any category below 4 → DO NOT IMPLEMENT.

No averaging permitted.

---

## Approval Gate

All features default to UNAPPROVED.

Execution cannot begin unless Approved = O.

Workflow state does not imply approval.

---

## Workflow Model

Backlog  
In Progress  
Blocked  
Review  
Done

Execution rules:

- Approval required before In Progress.
- Dependencies must resolve before progression.
- Governance overrides workflow.

---

# IV. CORRECTIONS APPLIED DURING AUDIT

The following corrections were applied before lock:

1. Removed Vanilla Score averaging logic.
2. Clarified that Approved count only reflects explicit approvals.
3. Removed optional snapshot language.
4. Reaffirmed default UNAPPROVED state.

No gameplay mechanics were introduced or modified.

---

# V. SNAPSHOT RULES

This snapshot is immutable.

If governance changes:

- A new snapshot must be created.
- Previous snapshots remain unmodified.
- Changes are append-only.

No retroactive edits.

---

# VI. EFFECTIVE DATE

Governance Lock effective as of:

2026-02-17

All future feature proposals must comply.
