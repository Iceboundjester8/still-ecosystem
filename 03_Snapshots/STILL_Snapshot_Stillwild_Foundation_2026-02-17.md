# STILL — SNAPSHOT
## Title: Stillwild Foundation Lock (v1)
## Snapshot ID: STILL_Snapshot_Stillwild_Foundation_2026-02-17
## Date: 2026-02-17
## Scope: Core World Systems (stillwild)
## Status: Locked

---

# I. SNAPSHOT PURPOSE

This snapshot locks the foundational world systems of stillwild.

These systems define:

- Time-based material change
- Environmental decay
- Ambient world life
- Preservation logic
- World-first design behavior

This snapshot freezes core architecture only.
Variants and expansions remain separate.

---

# II. LOCKED WORLD SYSTEMS

The following systems are now foundational canon:

## 1. Wood Aging System

- Time-based blockstate progression
- Fresh → Aged → Rotten → Infested
- Visual-only degradation
- No stat modification
- No tool gating

Decay communicates through:
- Texture shift
- Shape change
- Sound variation

No UI indicators.

---

## 2. Wet / Dry State System

- Tracks waterlogged or environmental wetness
- Wet accelerates decay
- Dry slows decay
- Fully environmental
- No player meter

Water presence only affects block logic.
No buffs or penalties applied to player.

---

## 3. Wax Preservation System

- Player-applied preservation layer
- Slows decay progression
- Does not reverse history
- Inspired by vanilla honeycomb logic

Wax:
- Prevents further decay bias
- Does not reset block age
- Is removable

No optimization incentive.

---

## 4. Termite System

- Ambient entity
- Accelerates wood decay
- Prefers aged wood
- Creates infestation state

No combat loop.
No loot progression.
No boss scaling.

Termites are environmental accelerators only.

---

## 5. Infestation State

- Internal block condition
- Hidden population logic
- No UI counter
- Expressed through sound and subtle visual cues

Infestation does not escalate into raids or events.

---

## 6. Ambient Life Layer

Includes:

- Insects
- Beetles
- Birds
- Night sound shifts

All ambient.
No player-interactive power gain.

---

## 7. Erosion & Terrain Subtlety

- Micro terrain shifts
- Moss growth
- Subtle cave variation
- Ruin weathering

World evolves quietly.
No forced events.

---

# III. DESIGN GUARANTEES

Stillwild must:

- Function without player interaction
- Communicate through environment only
- Allow escape as success
- Avoid optimization loops
- Avoid visible system tracking

If the player ignores the mod,
the world still turns.

---

# IV. EXPLICIT NON-INCLUSIONS

The following are permanently excluded from stillwild foundation:

- Bosses
- Combat scaling
- Loot escalation
- Automation rewards
- Resource progression loops
- UI meters
- Environmental debuff systems

Stillwild is world-first, not player-first.

---

# V. GOVERNANCE ALIGNMENT

All systems above:

- Passed My Vanilla Test (all categories ≥ 4)
- Approved = O prior to lock
- Do not violate Hard Cuts
- Are variant-extensible but mechanic-stable

Foundation mechanics are frozen.

Variants may expand visuals and entities only.

---

# VI. SNAPSHOT RULES

This snapshot is immutable.

Future changes require:

- New snapshot ID
- Append-only revision
- Governance re-evaluation

No retroactive modification.

---

# VII. EFFECTIVE DATE

Stillwild Foundation Lock effective:

2026-02-17
